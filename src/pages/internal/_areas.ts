 * The internal pages' structure, in one place: the areas the floating island links to, and the
 * pages each area's top bar shows as tabs.
 *
 * - COMPONENTS: the homepage's sections, each on its own page (the ecosystem cards included, in
 *   their gallery), and the product-page pieces judged with them.
 * - FLOWS: the paths behind a button that leads to Cloud, one page per button.
 * - DESIGN SYSTEM: what every page is built from. Type and UI; Color joins them later.
 *
 * Every area has the same shape: an overview of tiles, then its pages. The island opens an area on
 * its overview; the top bar then switches between the pages, as tabs while there are few and as a
 * grouped picker once there are more than `TABS_UP_TO` (see `_AreaBar`).
 * URLs did not move with the areas: `/internal/sections/<id>/` is cited across the codebase, and the
 * library pages keep theirs. The areas are the structure; the paths are only addresses.
