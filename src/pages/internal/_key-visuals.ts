/**
 * The key visuals: one entry per page under Components › Sections and Flows. Copy is the design's,
 * verbatim.
 *
 * Its own module because the sandbox page and every one of its panels needs it, and a panel that
 * had to reach back into the page for it would be a panel that cannot be moved or deleted on its
 * own. Addressed by id through `kv()`, never by array position: the panels used to say
 * `KEY_VISUALS[6]`, which meant inserting a visual silently retitled four others. That is also what
 * makes the order below free to change — this array decides the menus' order and nothing else.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE PAGE'S ORDER. The hero first, then platform: it opens the homepage's content as
 * a centred section above the rows. Then the rows in the order `index.astro` runs them, so walking the section menu
 * walks the page. `ai` sits between twin and normalize because that is where `AiSection` runs: a
 * full-bleed section rather than a row, but on the page there. Then the sections the running orders
 * brought or reworked — the use cases, the trust band — around `products` and `ecosystem`, and
 * "Why choose" and the customer voices close the homepage run. The hub and the menus do not read this
 * order for the homepage group: they follow the shipping running order (see `ON_HOME` below).
 * After it, what is not on the homepage: `choice`, which ships on the product pages instead, then
 * gateway, deploy and whitelabel, drawn and waiting for a section. The flows come last, in their
 * own area.
