/**
 * Content for the scale half of "Deploy anywhere, scale without surprises".
 *
 * The section carries two claims that want two different pictures: that the platform scales, and
 * that it runs on any ground. This file is the first. The second — Cloud, on-premises, fully
 * offline — is a deployment and commercial story, and the free plan belongs with it rather than
 * here, because "5 devices, no card" is a fact about how you buy ThingsBoard and not about how it
 * behaves under load.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER BELOW IS FROM THE REPO'S OWN BENCHMARKS, not from a marketing estimate. See
 * `_includes/docs/reference/architecture/performance.mdx` (scenarios B, D and E, each a 24h+ run on
 * AWS EC2 with MQTT smart-meter emulators) and `deployment-scenarios.mdx` for the sizing. The draft
 * this replaces put "one server with PostgreSQL" at 10K devices; the benchmark puts the same
 * sentence at 100K, and Scenario A tops a standalone monolith out near 300K. The honest number is
 * an order of magnitude better than the one we were about to claim.

// A fifth cut, and the first drawn from a proposal rather than from the benchmark tables.

// The proposal was a SLIDER: drag from 5 devices to 5M+ and a card answers with a badge, a stack
// and a sentence. Three things in it are kept — the reader's own fleet as the way in, one range
// rather than a menu, and three facts per answer. The slider is not, because a homepage visual is
// read rather than operated, because a readout of "4.9M" is a precision that is an artifact of
// pixel position, and because the range ran to 5M+ when nothing in this repo benchmarks past 1M.
//
// WHAT THE SLIDER GOT RIGHT AND THIS FILE HAD WRONG. The proposal put single-node at about 10K
// devices. The first draft of this cut put it at 100K, taken from the docs. Worked through, the
// proposal is closer to honest, and the two numbers are not in conflict — they are the same server
// under different workloads. PostgreSQL carries ~5,000 data points/sec, which at 3 data points a
// message is ~1,667 messages/sec, so ONE SERVER HOLDS:
//
//     devices reporting every 10 s      ~16,700     <- the proposal's ~10K
//     devices reporting every 60 s      ~100,000    <- the figure taken from the docs
//     devices reporting every 15 min    ~1,500,000
//
// The benchmark labelled "100K devices" is a 90-second interval (1,111 msg/sec across 100K
// devices); `deployment-scenarios` describes 100K meters at a 15-minute interval. Two pages, the
// same headline number, assumptions an order of magnitude apart. Meanwhile the docs' own 20K GPS
// trackers produce 10,000 data points/sec, which is TWICE what PostgreSQL will take — so a single
// server does not reach 100K of anything that reports often.
//
// Hence: every tier is a RANGE, not a point, and the interval that sets it is stated once
// underneath. A single number here is the thing that generates the support ticket.

 * Section copy for the abstract candidate, kept SEPARATE from `SCALE_COPY` above.
 *
 * `SCALE_COPY` feeds `_key-visuals.ts`, which feeds the home preview and every other feature row in
 * the sandbox, so rewriting it in place would re-caption four visuals it was not written for. This
 * is passed to the candidate's row directly instead. Fold it into `SCALE_COPY` only if and when the
 * candidate is promoted.
 *
 * Written against what the candidate actually shows, because the old body no longer matched it:
 *
 *   - "From a pilot on one small server to a million devices" promised a million on ONE SERVER,
 *     while the card beside it says 300K there and reserves the million for hybrid storage. The two
 *     halves of the row disagreed about the same number.
 *   - "you know the machine, the database, and how much headroom is left" described ScaleGrowth,
 *     which prints CPU headroom and instance specs. This cut deliberately drops both.
 *   - "Every step is benchmarked" had nothing left to point at once the benchmark figures came out
 *     of the drawing — so the claim moves into the copy, where the link can carry it.
 *
 * It also lands the interval caveat that has been homeless all along: the visual cannot say that a
 * data-point rate rather than a device count decides which column you are in, and a sentence can.

// A seventh cut. Two deployment modes and nothing else — hybrid storage stops being a thing on the
// page at all, and becomes what it actually is: a choice of database, listed with the others.
//
// That is the last piece of the category error to go. Monolith and Cluster are the docs' two
// deployment architectures; SQL and Hybrid are a database mode. Earlier cuts drew the database mode
// as a third card, then as a step, then as a band joining two cards. Listing PostgreSQL, Citus and
// Cassandra side by side on each card says the same thing with no extra furniture: these are what
// you can run underneath, and which one you pick is a rate question rather than a topology one.
//
// It also resolves a contradiction that has been in the row since the copy was written. The section
// says "From a pilot on one small server to a million devices", and every previous cut put 300K on
// the single-server card and reserved the million for a second one — so the sentence and the drawing
// disagreed about the same number. Benchmark E ran 1M devices on ONE ThingsBoard instance, so the
// million belongs on that card, and the original copy is correct beside this visual for the first
// time.
