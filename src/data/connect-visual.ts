 * supported. So the names carry the size and the route is demoted to a caption.

 * here on purpose — fixing them IS the four-route set, and patching them in place would leave two

 * as a chip (you integrate with a network SERVER — ChirpStack, TTN, LORIOT — never with LoRaWAN
 * itself) and "NB-IoT" (a radio technology, not a connection method; it appears in the docs only
