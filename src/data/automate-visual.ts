/**
 * Content for the Automate switch: the "Turn IoT data into action" row as three drawings on one
 * skeleton, chosen by a switch over the row's media.
 *
 * `normalize-visual.ts` has said since it was written that this row makes two arguments — "any
 * protocol, one model" and "then act on it" — and that the second needed a picture of its own. These
 * are that picture, split in the order data actually moves: NORMALIZE (the shipped `NormalizeSeries`,
 * untouched), FILTER (a day of door openings, and the one that becomes an alarm) and NOTIFY (that one
 * alarm, and everyone it reaches). The row's paragraph already names all three, so it stays as it is.
 *
 * ONE FREEZER, ALL THE WAY DOWN. The AI demo above asks to "email the manager if a freezer stays
 * open" and creates a CRITICAL alarm rule called ‘Freezer Door Open’ that fires past three minutes.
 * Filter and Notify are that rule running: the same name, the same threshold, the same manager. Keep
 * them in step with `AI_ASSISTANT_DEMO` if either changes.
