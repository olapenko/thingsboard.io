 * WHAT CHANGED FROM THE PROTOTYPE, and why — the port is to this page's ladder, not char-for-char:
 *
 * - The prototype's section eyebrow ("AI · Built into the ThingsBoard IoT platform") is dropped.
 *   This page states a section's subject with `SectionHeader`'s squircle badge, not with a kicker;
 *   every other section on the homepage does, and an eyebrow here would be the only one.
 * - The title loses its hard `<br>`. `SectionHeader` balances its own lines and the page's measure
 *   is 1000, not the prototype's 1240 — the break landed mid-phrase here.
 * - The column eyebrows ("From a prompt", "From your terminal") are KEPT. They are the section's
 *   argument — the same platform reached two ways — and nothing else says it.

 * kicker, where it still reads first.
 *
 * Every claim is taken from the docs rather than written for effect:
 *
 *   Assistant  `user-guide/ai-assistant` — knows the platform and SEES YOUR DATA ("say 'my pumps'
 *              instead of listing device IDs"); configures Dashboards, Alarm Rules, Calculated
 *              Fields and Notifications; "never modifies your tenant without your confirmation".
 *   CLI        `user-guide/cli-solutions` — you describe the change to your AI coding agent and it
 *              builds, evolves and fixes the solution; "the agent commits every change it makes,
 *              so your whole IoT setup lives in git"; "the same project files deploy to dev,
 *              staging, and production" with `tb push`.
 *
 * ⚠ NOT "AI agents of your choice". The CLI supports exactly two agents today — Claude Code and
 * Antigravity (`tb init` writes `.claude/` or `.agents/` + `AGENTS.md`) — so the body names them
 * and the headline says "your coding agent". Widen it when the docs do.
 *
 * Headlines are held near 40 characters, the copy column's measure, so each balances onto two
 * lines like the rows above.
 *
 * The SWITCH names who does the work — "Ask the Assistant" / "Brief your agent" — rather than
 * where the input goes ("From a prompt" / "From your terminal"). Action-led, and the second half
 * is honest about the CLI's model: you brief an agent, it drives the CLI. It does repeat
 * "Assistant" with the chat's kicker; that was weighed and accepted. On a phone neither label fits
 * half the switch, so the short forms keep the pair parallel: "Assistant" / "Agent".

/**
 * The hues the section's mark cycles through: every OTHER section's badge colour on this page.
 *
 * READ FROM THOSE SECTIONS RATHER THAN RETYPED, which is the whole point of the export. The claim
 * the animation makes is "these are the colours this page is built out of" — a copied list would
 * stop being true the first time one of them was retuned, and would do it silently, because nothing
 * would look broken. Imported, the cycle follows the palette.
 *
 * ORDERED TO AVOID MUD, not by section order. CSS interpolates `background-color` through sRGB, so a
 * leg between two distant hues passes through the desaturated middle of the cube — green to orange
 * goes through olive, which is the one pairing on this page that reads as a rendering fault rather
 * than as a colour. The orange is the outlier (hue 22° against a spread of 150–268°) and it has to
 * sit next to something, so it sits between the two violets, where the midpoints are a plum and a
 * mulberry — colours, not sludge. The rest runs down the wheel: violet, blue, teal, green, and back
 * to the section's own indigo through a blue-teal.
 *
 * The first stop is NOT in this list: the cycle starts and ends at `AI_COPY.badge.color`, so the
 * mark is its own colour at rest and the animation is a departure that returns.
