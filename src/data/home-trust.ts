/**
 * The trust band: three cards between the use cases and Products — security, scale, openness — each
 * opening on a small drawing (`TrustVisual`) rather than an icon.
 *
 * It answers what a reader brings to the Products band under it — is it safe, will it grow with me,
 * am I stuck with it — so that band can stay a choice between two deployments rather than an
 * argument for either.
 *
 * NO DEPLOYMENT CARD. There was one ("Deploy anywhere", the Deploy visual's fork), and it made the
 * Products band's own argument one band early and in less room: Products is where the Cloud or
 * On-premises split is explained, with a card each. Its slot went to the question Products does not
 * answer — whether building on ThingsBoard ties you to it.
 *
 * WHERE THE WORDS COME FROM, since none of them is new:
 * - Security is thingsboard.one's (2026-09-24/25): "ISO 27001 and ISO 9001 certified", the
 *   penetration test with no frequency attached (its pass removed "before each major release" and
 *   then "every year"), and the RBAC & SSO tile's two-factor sign-in.
 * - Scale is the Scale row's promise, which leaves the homepage for the On-premises page, said the
 *   way thingsboard.one now says it: "you scale the deployment, not your solution". Not its figure —
 *   that pass says "5+ million" where this repo benchmarks one million — so the card promises the
 *   move from one server to a cluster, which the drawing shows, and no number.
 * - Openness is the "Source-available & customization" tile's, with the device protocols and APIs
 *   the docs reference names (`reference/http-api`, `mqtt-api`, `coap-api`, `rest-api`).
 *
 * `Why choose` still runs further down with its own security, scalability and source tiles. The
 * cards here say what you can count on; the tiles say what is in the box, in more detail and with
 * their own links. Trim the tiles, not these, if the two start to read as one thing said twice.
