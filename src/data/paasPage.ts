			{
				q: 'What is ThingsBoard Cloud?',
				a: '<p>ThingsBoard Cloud is a fully managed, scalable, and fault-tolerant platform for your IoT applications.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'What pricing plans does ThingsBoard Cloud offer?',
				a: `<p>ThingsBoard Cloud offers flexible monthly subscription plans, with tiers based on the number of devices and the volume of messages they generate. We support 5 predefined plans to cater to different needs. The beginner plan includes up to 5 devices and 10 million data points. For more details, visit the ThingsBoard Cloud <a href="/pricing/?product=thingsboard-cloud">pricing</a> page.</p>`,
			},
			{
				q: 'How is ThingsBoard Cloud pricing structured?',
				a: `<p>Pricing is based on the number of connected devices and the volume of messages they generate. Each plan has a fixed monthly fee, with the option to purchase additional entity packs and API call packs. In this case, the total monthly cost consists of the base fee for the selected plan plus additional charges for extra features. More details are available on the <a href="${SUBSCRIPTIONS}">subscription plans</a> page.</p>`,
			},
			{
				q: 'Are there any API or rate limits?',
				a: `<p>Yes, each plan includes specific API and rate limits. If needed, you can extend these limits by purchasing additional API call packs. Detailed limits for each plan are available on the <a href="${SUBSCRIPTIONS}">subscription plans</a> page.</p>`,
			},
			{
				q: 'Do you offer a free trial?',
				a: '<p>Yes, we offer a free 30-day trial to let you explore ThingsBoard Cloud before committing to a paid plan.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'What is included in the free trial?',
				a: '<p>The free trial includes access to all core features and Trendz Analytics tool with limited usage of devices, messages, and storage.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan at any time?',
				a: '<p>Yes, you can change your plan at any time, and billing will be adjusted accordingly.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'How does ThingsBoard Cloud pricing compare to the on-premise version?',
				a: '<p>ThingsBoard Cloud eliminates infrastructure management costs, offering a predictable monthly fee, whereas the on-premise version requires separate hosting infrastructure and maintenance efforts.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: "What's the difference between ThingsBoard Cloud and on-premises subscriptions?",
				a: "<p>On-premises subscription plans include only the license fees and do not provide hosting services. This means you need to deploy ThingsBoard on an external cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) or a local server (on-premise). Additionally, you are responsible for managing the infrastructure and maintaining the ThingsBoard server.</p><p>On the other hand, ThingsBoard Cloud offers the same platform as a fully managed service, hosted on ThingsBoard's infrastructure. This eliminates the need for separate infrastructure costs and maintenance efforts.</p><p>For example, the on-premises Pilot subscription costs $99, whereas the ThingsBoard Cloud Pilot subscription is priced at $149. The price difference is due to the hosting fee included in the Cloud subscription.</p>",
			},
			{
				q: 'Are there any additional costs beyond the subscription fee?',
				a: '<p>No, all standard features are included in the subscription. However, additional services such as application configuration, integrations, or consulting may incur extra costs. In addition, if you exceed the limits of your selected plan, you can purchase extra entity packs and API call packs for an additional fee.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: "What happens if I exceed my plan's limits?",
				a: '<p>If you exceed your limits, you may need to upgrade to a higher plan or reduce your usage. You can also purchase additional entity packs and API call packs; however, extra devices can only be purchased with the Business plan. If you reach the device limit, you will need to upgrade your plan.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'Can I create a custom plan with the ability to choose limits for devices, assets, users, etc.?',
				a: '<p>ThingsBoard Cloud offers predefined base plans that can be further customized with additional entity packs and API call packs.</p>',

			{
				q: 'Can I purchase ThingsBoard Cloud for a short-term project?',
				a: '<p>Yes, you can subscribe for a single month and cancel anytime.</p>',

				q: 'How to cancel my subscription?',
				a: `<p>Kindly refer to the <a href="${SUBSCRIPTIONS}#cancel-subscription">subscription cancellation guide</a>.</p>`,
			},
			{
				q: 'How to migrate from the Cloud to an on-premises platform instance?',
				a: `<p>We recommend using the <a href="/docs/pe/user-guide/version-control/">Version control</a> feature to migrate your configurations. Telemetry data export can be achieved via REST API. Please, <a href="${CONTACT}">contact us</a> in case migration assistance is needed.</p>`,

				q: 'How to bill my customers on Cloud?',
				a: `<p>Currently, ThingsBoard Cloud does not provide a built-in billing module to charge end customers.

		title: 'Private Cloud',
		items: [
			{
				q: 'What does “ThingsBoard Private Cloud” stand for?',
				a: '<p>ThingsBoard Private Cloud is a fully managed, isolated ThingsBoard cluster that our team deploys and operates for you. We provision the infrastructure, keep the platform patched and monitored 24×7, run automated backups, and provide an SLA-backed uptime guarantee (99%–99.99%, depending on plan). During onboarding, you choose the region that best fits your compliance or latency requirements—EU, North America, or APAC. All environments are hosted in ISO 27001/PCI-DSS-certified data centers. Your engineers can stay focused on building IoT applications instead of managing DevOps.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'How Private Cloud compares to ThingsBoard Cloud and On-premises?',
				a: '<ul><li>On-premises deployments live on infrastructure you operate; you gain total control and customisation, yet you also own every patch, backup and compliance task.</li><li>ThingsBoard Cloud is the quickest way to try ThingsBoard: a SaaS environment that we maintain for you, but shared with other tenants.</li><li>Private Cloud is a fully managed, isolated cluster run by the ThingsBoard team, with a contractual 99.9–99.99 % SLA and your choice of region—ideal when you need zero DevOps and hard uptime guarantees.</li></ul>',
			},
			{
				q: 'What are the benefits of Private Cloud versus self-hosting?',
				a: '<ul><li>Zero DevOps overhead – no servers to set up, patch or monitor.</li><li>Guaranteed availability – written SLA of 99.9 – 99.99 %, with service-credit remedies.</li><li>Faster time-to-market – we stand up production clusters in 1-2 hours, not weeks.</li><li>Scalability – Kubernetes-based plans grow as device traffic spikes.</li><li>Predictable cost – one all-inclusive monthly fee replaces cap-ex plus staffing.</li></ul>',
			},
			{
				q: 'What is ‘uptime’ and how do you calculate it?',
				a: '<p>Uptime (%) = ((Total Time – Downtime) / Total Time) × 100.</p><p>Total Time – number of minutes in the billing month.</p><p>Downtime – minutes when core platform services are unavailable for the tenant (device endpoints, REST/WebSocket APIs, Rule Engine infrastructure, dashboards, telemetry DB).</p><p>We measure Downtime from incident detection to full service restoration.</p><p>Excluded from Downtime:</p><ul><li>Scheduled maintenance announced ≥ 48 h in advance</li><li>Emergency security patches</li><li>Force-majeure events or upstream cloud failures (e.g., cloud provider region outage)</li><li>Issues caused by customer-side logic (mis-configured Rule Chains, custom JS, connector errors, abusive API use, edge gateways, etc.)</li></ul>',
			},
			{
				q: 'What deployment options are available within Private Cloud?',
				a: '<p>Private Cloud is offered in three fixed tiers—Launch, Growth, and Scale—each designed to support different stages of your IoT deployment journey. The Enterprise plan is tailored for your use case and offers flexible architecture, pricing and custom SLA.</p><p>All plans are powered by Kubernetes, with built-in load balancers to ensure resilient, scalable operations. AWS is our first-choice IaaS, but Azure or GCP regions are also supported on request.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'What is Automatic Backup?',
				a: '<p>It is a configured process that regularly creates secure copies of the database with all telemetry, configurations, entities, and related data to avoid data loss in case of failure and enable recovery.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'What support is included?',
				a: '<p>All plans include access to the ThingsBoard Support Portal for direct communication with the support team in case of questions related to ThingsBoard functionality.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'Who should choose Private Cloud?',
				a: '<p>Private Cloud ideal for companies that want to avoid investing in DevOps resources, reduce operational risk, and accelerate time to market. They are particularly beneficial for startups, SMBs, or enterprises scaling production systems who prefer to offload platform operations and upgrades to the ThingsBoard team under a clear SLA.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'How do I determine the right Private Cloud plan for my workload?',
				a: '<p>To select an appropriate Private Cloud plan, you’ll need to estimate your expected platform usage based on three key indicators:</p><p>1. Number of devices:</p><ul><li>Navigate to the Home page of your ThingsBoard Tenant account.</li><li>Check the total number of devices currently connected.</li></ul><p>2. Number of Messages per Day per Device:</p><ul><li>Navigate to API Usage → Transport Messages chart</li><li>Find the monthly total of transport messages</li><li>Use this formula: Messages per day per device = (Monthly Transport Messages) / (Number of devices × Number of Days in Month)</li></ul><p>3. Number of Data Points per Message:</p><ul><li>In the same API Usage → Transport Messages chart</li><li>Identify the Data Points per Month figure</li><li>Use this formula: Data Points per Message = Data Points per Month / Transport Messages per Month</li></ul><p>Once you’ve collected these three values, you can match your usage against the limits defined in each Private Cloud plan tier (Launch, Growth, Scale, Enterprise) to determine the best fit.</p><p>For more guidance, you can share these metrics with our team, we’ll be happy to help you size your environment.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'Is there a minimum commitment?',
				a: '<p>No long-term lock-in. We simply ask for a 30-day written notice before shutdown so we can decommission resources cleanly.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'Where will my data be hosted?',
				a: '<p>During onboarding you pick the region that best fits compliance or latency needs (EU, North America, or APAC). All sites reside in ISO 27001/PCI-DSS-certified data centres.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'How can I get my data in line with GDPR requirements?',
				a: '<p>You can request a complete encrypted database dump at any time. We generate a full PostgreSQL dump of all tenant-level tables (entities, telemetry, audit logs, custom metadata) and transfer it to you over a secure channel (SFTP or your own cloud bucket).</p><p>Because the export is a raw DB dump, you retain 100 % data fidelity and can immediately restore it in another PostgreSQL instance or transform it into any machine-readable format you need. We normally fulfill export requests within 5 business days, and—in line with GDPR—can also execute verified deletion of all tenant data within 30 days of your erase request.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'Is your Private Cloud service GDPR-compliant?',
				a: '<p>Yes. You remain the sole Data Controller; ThingsBoard acts as a Data Processor under a standard DPA. Data never leaves the region you select, and you have the right to access, port or delete it at will.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'Will I have a sysadmin user?',
				a: '<p>For security and SLA integrity we do not expose Sysadmin by default. If your workflow truly needs low-level access, we can provide read-only credentials to metrics/Kubernetes dashboards under an additional NDA.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'What kind of security measurements do you provide?',
				a: '<p>Private Cloud is designed with enterprise-grade security at its core. Access to the infrastructure is limited to authorized ThingsBoard personnel only, with regular audits and monitoring in place. We follow industry best practices for patch management, vulnerability scanning, and secure software development. For added protection, customers may also enable 2FA, dedicated VPN tunnels, and audit logging depending on their plan.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'How often are upgrades conducted?',
				a: '<p>All Private Cloud upgrades—whether minor patches or major version releases—are scheduled in coordination with the customer. This ensures full transparency, minimizes disruption, and allows your team to prepare in advance. Our team handles the entire upgrade process and provides clear communication before and after each change to maintain operational continuity and SLA compliance.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'Can I upgrade my plan at any time?',
				a: '<p>Upgrades are possible at any time, but they are not initiated automatically. The ThingsBoard team continuously monitors your resource usage and data point throughput. If your consumption exceeds the thresholds defined for your current tier, our team will notify you and guide the process of upgrading to a higher plan. This ensures uninterrupted service and compliance with SLA guarantees. You can also request an upgrade proactively if you anticipate growth or require additional capabilities.</p>',
			},
			{
				q: 'What is included in service reviews and architecture consultations?',
				a: '<p>Service reviews and architecture consultations are a specialized, ongoing service available exclusively to ThingsBoard Private Cloud customers. These sessions provide structured, high-level guidance from a senior ThingsBoard engineer who collaborates with your team regularly. You’ll receive proactive recommendations on best practices, performance tuning, and scalable architecture design tailored to your evolving use case.</p><p>This service is not included by default and can be purchased separately for customers who require advanced architectural guidance and regular expert engagement. <a href="/contact-us/?subject=Private%20Cloud&amp;message=Architecture%20reviews%20and%20consults">Contact us</a> for more details.</p>',

/**
 * The two calls to action the develop page repeats in its hero and closing band.

 * self-hosted page rather than a decision. It points at the Cloud signup, which is where the
