/**
 * Content for the platform overview: your equipment on one side, your people on the other, and
 * what runs between them in the middle.
 *
 * Adapted from a standalone HTML sandbox that carried two arrow layouts — arrows inline in the
 * gutters, and arrows routed through bands above and below the platform ("in & out"). Only the
 * second one is here. The inline version put all four runs on the same horizontal line as the
 * cards, which made the two directions read as one two-way pipe; separating them into an upper
 * band and a lower band is what turns the picture into a loop, and the loop is the argument.
 *
 * Four runs, clockwise: telemetry comes in from the equipment, views and alerts go out to the
 * people, actions come back in from the people, commands and updates go back out to the equipment.
 * Every run has a named source and a named destination, so the colour of a line is never a
 * decoration — it is the zone the line starts in.
 *
 * The icons are Tabler names, resolved by `astro-icon` at build time. The sandbox they came from
 * shipped a 40 KB inlined icon map and a picker for choosing between a dozen candidates per slot;
 * the picking is done, so what survives is the chosen name.

/**
 * The homepage's centred section: the statement between the hero and the five rows, with
 * `PlatformRaised` under it.
 *
 * It was sandbox-only and is not any more — `index.astro` renders this now, in place of the
 * statement that used to be there. That displaced `HOME_INTRO`, which was the published wording, so
 * the old copy is worth knowing about: it is in the commit that deleted `data/home-intro.ts` and one
 * revert away if this section does not survive review.
 *
 * The heading drops the link. "ThingsBoard" is the first word of a sentence here, and a link inside
 * it is a second thing to look at in the largest line on the page — which is also why the homepage
 * paints its own wordmark black rather than blue.
 *
 * The lede does NOT describe the drawing. The first draft did — three sources, four steps, three
 * audiences, both directions — and it was the caption to a picture the reader is already looking at,
 * which is the one job a lede under a diagram does not have. The drawing says what the parts are;
 * the words have to say why any of it is worth having.
 *
 * So: scope, the correction, and where it runs. The claim is that ThingsBoard's own four stages are
 * one product — NOT that the reader will not be integrating anything. The lede now says the opposite
 * of that out loud, because Connect IS the first stage and `CONNECT_COPY` sells integrations by name
 * one section below. "Nothing to integrate between them" read as a blanket denial, contradicted both
 * the drawing beside it and the product; what survives is the same claim scoped to where it is true,
 * between the stages.
 *
 * The third sentence answers the "deploy, and scale" two thirds of the heading, which the old lede
 * ignored — and takes its vocabulary from the products band lower on the same page, where the pair
 * is "Fully managed SaaS" and "Deployed on your infrastructure".
 *
 * DO NOT put the broker in any parts list here. TBMQ is a separate product on this same page, and
 * `homeEcosystem` has it picking up where ThingsBoard's MQTT transport stops — so a one-platform
 * list containing it is disprovable by scrolling, exactly the way "nothing to buy as an add-on" was.
 *
 * IT USED TO SAY "and nothing to buy as an add-on", and that was false on its own page: Edge and
 * Trendz are `addOn: true` in `homeEcosystem`, and the products band renders the badge on both about
 * a hundred lines below this section. A lede that a reader can disprove by scrolling is worse than a
 * shorter one. The same sentence was in `PLATFORM_COPY.body` and has been cut there too.
 *
 * Nothing here is a competitive claim either — "fewer products than the alternatives" would need a
 * number this repo does not have.

/**
 * What the platform does, as four stages in the order you meet them. The names are verbs because
 * the column beside them is a list of nouns, and the contrast is what says one side is a thing you
 * own and the other is work being done to it.
 *
 * EACH STAGE IS CODED AS A SECTION OF THE PAGE. The colour comes from that section's badge, by
 * reference rather than by copy, so the two cannot drift apart:
 *
 *   Connect   -> the connect section        #007c7b
 *   Model     -> the digital twin section   #7a37e7
 *   Automate  -> the normalize section      #b44100
 *   Operate   -> the solution section       #3d50f5
 *
 * Whoever reads the diagram meets each of these four again further down, in the same colour. Two
 * things keep that from being the full legend it once claimed to be, and they are worth stating
 * rather than leaving to be discovered:
 *
 *   - THE ORDER DIFFERS. Left to right the stages run connect, twin, normalize, solution; top to
 *     bottom the page runs connect, solution, twin, normalize, scale. The mapping is by MEANING,
 *     which is right — Operate is dashboards, so it takes the solution row — but it means the two
 *     sequences only agree on the first one.
 *   - SCALE IS NOT HERE. The fifth row's green appears nowhere in this drawing, because there is no
 *     fifth stage for it to attach to.
 *
 * THE ICONS ARE THE STAGE'S OWN, not the section's badge glyph, and are the four the original
 * drawing chose. A section badge has to stand for a whole section in one mark; a stage here sits
 * above a verb and a line of detail and only has to stand for that. Where the two agree they are
 * the same glyph — Connect takes `plug-connected` either way — and where they do not, the stage
 * wins: `binary-tree` reads as branching logic beside "Rule chains", which is Automate's job, and
 * the twin's own box is what `DigitalTwin.astro` draws its unit with, which is Model's.
